# Contributing to DevLifts API

Please read through [our current open issues](https://github.com/DevLifts/fit-cli/projects) for the current release and see if there's anything you'd like to work on! Also, please check out [this project's roadmap](https://spectrum.chat/?t=22795602-8652-4962-aa70-e1bb03cec836) to ensure you don't do any work that's not in line with where we're trying to go.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for this project. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including. Open an issue if you can't find one related to what you want to work on.
